# WebStencils

Page editors are a great way to provide an excellent user experience.
However, to build one is often a pretty dreadful task.

There are existing libraries that come with a fully working page editor out of the box with a user interface and editable components.
However, if you wish to make customizations such as modifying the user interface and its behavior, it will most definitely involve modifying the library itself.

WebStencils solves this problem by modularizing the building blocks of a page editor. 
It ships with a drag-n-drop system and handles the way user components should be rendered, updated and moved - among other things. 
With this, you'll be able to build your own page editor exactly how you want it to look and behave.
